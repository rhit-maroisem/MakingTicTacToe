# Making TicTacToe
## Author: Ã‰mile Marois

### Summary:
    This is my first Ruby project. Just trying to get the basics down
    while practicing TDD and learning how Ruby and RubyMine work
    A small project, but a good start!

### Details:
- Coded in RubyMine
- All tests located in "tests" folder
- Run Start.rb to run the app
- Game is fully flexible to be played with a larger board than a 3x3,
though this cannot be accessed yet
